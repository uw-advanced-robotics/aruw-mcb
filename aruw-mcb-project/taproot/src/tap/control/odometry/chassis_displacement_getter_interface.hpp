/**
 * Interface for getting chassis displacement in chassis frame
 *
 * Each call to getChassisDisplacement should return the chassis displacement
 * in the chassis frame since the last call.
 *
 * While on flat ground, the chassis positive z-axis is defined as "up" (opposite
 * gravity), positive x-axis is defined as the chassis forward vector, and
 * thus consequently the positive y-axis is chassis "left".
 *
 * Unless you use GPS or some other absolute positioning system, it is expected
 * that over long periods the displacement may not be the most accurate. However
 * if the chassis displacement is queried fast and often the accuracy of the
 * accumulated displacement should be better than it would if it were queried
 * at a lower frequently (like any quasi-integration).
 *
 * Getting chassis displacement may fail as implementor chooses to indicate
 * either values are too stale or sensor went offline etc.
 *
 * @note The RoboMaster robot building specification manual mentions a coordinate
 *      convention for chassis orientations. Their coordinate convention is different
 *      in that they assert positive z as pointing "towards the center of the Earth".
