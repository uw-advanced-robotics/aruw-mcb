 * Encapsulates the logic necessary for determining the location of the cursor
 * and the smallest and largset indices to be displayed on the OLED display.
 *
 * For example, suppose we have a menu with 10 entries but only 5 fit on the
 * screen at one time. Initially, the user's cursor starts at index 0 and indices
 * 0 and 4 are the min and max indices displayed by the OLED display. When the user
 * presses the down button a few times such that the cursor index is 5, the min and
 * max indices must be shifted by 1 so they are now 1 and 5. This class handles
 * this sort of logic for you. Call this function in a menu's `shortButtonPress`
 * function and use the known `cursorIndex`, `smallestIndexDisplayed`, and
 * `largestIndexDisplayed` when drawing.
 *
 * @note Zero indexing is used.
