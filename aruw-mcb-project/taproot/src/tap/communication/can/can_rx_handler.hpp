/**
 * A handler that stores pointers to CanRxListener and that watches
 * CAN 1 and CAN 2 for messages. If messages are received, it checks
 * its internal maps for a `CanRxListener` that matches the message
 * identifier and CAN bus and calls the listener's `processMessage`
 * function.
 *
 * Interfaces with modm receive data from CAN1 and CAN2 buses.
 *
 * To use, extend CanRxListener class and create a method called
 * processMessage. Next, call the function attachReceiveHandler,
 * which will add the class you instantiated to a list of classes
 * that will be handled on receive. The class you created and
 * attached will be called by the pollCanData function
 * every time there is a message available that has the CAN identifier
 * matching the identifier specified in the CanRxListener constructor.
 *
 * For proper closed loop motor control, it is necessary to have the
 * pollCanData function be called at a very high frequency,
 * so call this in a high frequency thread.
 *
 * @see `CanRxListener` for information about how to properly create
 *      add a listener to the handler.
 * @see `Can` for modm CAN wrapper functions.
