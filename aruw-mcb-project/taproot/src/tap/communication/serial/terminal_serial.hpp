/**
 * Handles incoming requests from the "terminal". The "terminal" is either
 * a uart line connected to a computer with a serial connection open or
 * when runing on the simulator, stdin/stdout.
 *
 * To add a handler to the terminal, extend the ITerminalSerialCallback
 * and add it to an instance of the TerminalSerial class via `addHeader`.
 * Whenever the header is received on the terminal line, the contents of
 * the message (minus the header and any flags specified for the TerminalSerial)
 * will be passed on to the registered callback via terminalSerialCallback.
 *
 * @note If the "-S" flag is specified directly after the header, the terminal
 *      enters streaming mode. In this mode, so long as terminalSerialCallback
 *      returns true when streaming mode is initially enabled, the
 *      ITerminalSerialCallback's `terminalSerialStreamCallback` function will
 *      be called repeatedly until the user enters any new key presses. If you
 *      design an ITerminalSerialCallback that does not need/handle streaming,
 *      simply check the argument in `terminalSerialCallback` called `streamingEnabled`
 *      `return false` and write to the `outputStream` to notify the user that
 *      streaming is not enabled. An example of where you would use streaming
 *      mode is if you would like to have a mode that prints out motor information
 *      constantly without having to retype a command into the terminal.
