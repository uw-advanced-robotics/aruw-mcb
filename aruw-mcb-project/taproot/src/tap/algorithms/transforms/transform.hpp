/**
 Represents a transformation from one coordinate frame to another.

    A Transform from frame A to frame B defines a relationship between the two frames, such that a
    spatial measurement in frame A can be represented equivalently in frame B by applying a
    translational and rotational offset. This process is known as *applying* a transform.

    Transforms are specified as a translation and rotation of some "target" frame relative to some
    "source" frame. The "translation" is the target frame's origin in source frame, and the
    "rotation" is the target frame's orientation relative to the source frame's orientation.

    Conceptually, translations are applied "before" rotations. This means that the origin of the
    target frame is entirely defined by the translation in the source frame, and the rotation serves
    only to change the orientation of the target frame's axes relative to the source frame.

    Utilizes arm's CMSIS matrix operations.

    @param SOURCE represents the source frame of the transformation.
    @param TARGET represents the target frame of the transformation.
