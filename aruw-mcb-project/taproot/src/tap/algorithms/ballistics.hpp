 *      Guidelines on choosing this parameter:
 *      - If the target is moving very slow relative to bulletVelocity, 1 is probably enough.
 *      - For higher target speeds, 2-3 is probably a good estimate.
 *      - If the target is approaching the projectile speed, this algorithm may have a difficult
 *        time converging (but it may be possible with enough iterations).
 *      - If the target is moving faster than the projectile, this algorithm will diverge.
 * @param[out] turretPitch: The world-relative turret pitch (in radians above level) at which our
 * robot should aim to hit the given target, taking into account the path a projectile takes to hit
 * the target.
 * @param[out] turretYaw: Analogue of turret pitch
 * @param[out] projectedTravelTime: The expected time between projectile launch and impact with the
 * target, in seconds.
 * @param[in] pitchAxisOffset: The distance between the pitch and yaw axes (in meters)
 * as seen from a plane parallel to the ground. A positive offset indicates that
 * the pitch axis is located behind the yaw axis.
 * @return Whether or not a valid aiming solution was found. Out parameters only valid if true.
