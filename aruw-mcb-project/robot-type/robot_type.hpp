/**
 * @file robot_type.hpp
 *
 * @brief Header for intellisense
 *
 * This file exists solely to help syntax highlighting. We setup the VSCode configuration to
 * "include" this file for intellisense.
 *
 * `aruw-mcb` builds take a target option. This specifies which robot to build
 * for as different robots will have different subsystems and constants, so this file
 * allows the developer to view syntax highlighting for the robot they are developing
 * for to catch mistakes without having to rebuild the code every time.
 *
 * This file should **NOT** be included normally, as otherwise it will mess with the build system.
