 * relative to the chassis in a manner similar to `chassis_rel_drive.hpp`. When a turret is passed
 * into this command, user translational input is relative to the turret.
 *
 * The user specifies some rotation via the control operator interface (see
 * the function `getChassisRInput`). The chassis mounted IMU is used as feedback for a position
 * controller so that the user specified chassis rotation is absolute. This means the chassis will
 * attempt to maintain a particular world relative chassis rotation angle.
