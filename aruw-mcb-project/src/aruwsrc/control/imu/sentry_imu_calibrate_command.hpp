/**
 * A command whose job is to perform a calibration of the turret and chassis IMUs. Requires that the
 * robot has a turret and a chassis subsystem. Also requires that a turret IMU is connected via the
 * TurretMCBCanComm object.
 *
 * When this command is scheduled, it performs the following actions:
 * 1. Wait until the turret is online and either the chassis mpu6500 or turret MCB IMU is online.
 * 2. Command the pitch and yaw turret gimbals to move to PI/2 radians (forward and flat).
 * 3. Command the chassis to stay still.
 * 4. Pause until the chassis/turret subsystems are no longer moving.
 * 5. Send a calibration signal to the turret MCB.
 * 6. Send signal to onboard IMU to recalibrate.
 * 7. Wait until calibration is complete and then end the command.
