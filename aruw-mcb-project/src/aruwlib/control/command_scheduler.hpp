/**
 * Class for handling all the commands you would like to currently run.
 * Interfaces with the Subsystem and Command classes to provide a means
 * of safely scheduling multiple Commands and Subsystems. Checks are
 * provided while scheduling such that multiple commands that require
 * the same subsystem cannot run at the same time. Suppose for example
 * that you have a Command that moves a mechanical arm Subsystem to some
 * position and another Command that moves the same arm to a different
 * position. Obvious issues arise if one attempts to tell the Subsystem
 * to do two things at once. Using this class will disallow these two
 * Commands from being executed at the same time.
 *
 * This class contains a map of Subsystems -> Commands. The Subsystems
 * will be refreshed each time the CommandScheduler is ran. If there
 * are commands associated with the Subsystem, the CommandScheduler will
 * execute these commands as well. Additional less important features
 * are explained in more detail in the function definitions.
 *
 * The goal of this class is for the user to interace directly as
 * little as possible. Aside from calling `run` each time to update the
 * scheduler, the user should be interacting with the Command,
 * ComprisedCommand, Subsystem, and CommandMapper classes to add
 * and remove commands from the scheduler.
 *
 * The main use case will be to be refreshing all the main subsystems running
 * on the robot. To do so, you should call `getMainScheduler()` to access this
 * base scheduler. Here is an example of how to do this:
 *
 * ```
 * // A class that has Command as a base class.
 * CoolSubsystem sub;
 * // A class that has Subsystem as a base class that requires
 * // the subsystem above. In the constructor of the ControlCoolCommand,
 * // you must call `addSubsystemRequirement(dynamic_cast<Subsystem*>(subsystem))`;
 * ControlCoolCommand cmd(&sub);
 *
 * CommandScheduler::getMainScheduler().registerSubsystem(&sub);
 * CommandScheduler::getMainScheduler().addCommand(&cmd);
 *
 * while (1) {
 *     // The subsystem will refresh forever and the command until it is not finished.
 *     CommandScheduler::getMainScheduler().run();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The second use case for a CommandScheduler is in the ComprisedCommand class.
 * Here, you utilize the CommandScheduler to coordinate multiple commands inside a
 * single command. The usage is exactly the same as using the main CommandScheduler.
